<h2><u>A History</u></h2>
<p id="history"> 
    Egypt is one of the oldest countries in the world, with a 
    civization beginning from 3,000 B.C. to 2,000 B.C.. Cairo -
    originally called Fustat - was established in the 10th century
    and was slowly becoming one of the largest cities in the Islamic
    world with a population .  
</p>
<p>
    When people think of Egypt, most think of the pyramids of Giza, one
    of the Seven Wonders of the World. They are all located on the outskirts
    of Cairo, with the Pyramid of Khufu being the largest of them. Next
    to the pyramids is the Sphinx, which was used to represent the god
    Horus and was a symbol of worship. To learn more about these structures,
    click on the picture of the pyramids above.

<h2><u>Geography</u></h2>

<p id="geography">
    Egypt is located north east Africa, with its northern coast at the 
    Mediterranean Sea and its eastern coast at the Red Sea. Cairo is located
    by the Nile River, which runs from the Mediterranean Sea to other 
    countries below. The Suez Canal is a very famous canal that allows
    boats to travel from Europe to Asia without having to go around Africa.
</p>
<p>
    Egyptian climate is very hot, especially in Cairo. Compared to other major
    cities like Alexandria, Cairo is a very hot and humid city in the summer
    and a moderatley cold and rainy one in the winter. Suprisingly,
    the best time to visit Cairo is during the winter, as the temperatures
    are the most bearable.

<h2><u>Travel Necessities</u></h2>
<p id="travel">
    There are many sites to see in Cairo, so you will probably stay there 
    a few days. There are many hotels located in Cairo, including a 
    <a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/egypt/ramses-hilton-CAIRHTW/index.html" target="_blank">Hilton</a>
    and a <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/cairofr/" target="_blank">Four Seasons</a>. 
    Cairo is also a very crowded city, and it is hard to get around unless you are an 
    experienced driver, therefore renting a car is not an option. You can't take
    the public transportation as well because it is not very trust worthy. The 
    best option is to either call an Uber or to get a tour guide to take you 
    from place to place.
